# Development Workflow

Rules for issues, branches, commits, and PRs. Designed for a solo dev working with AI agents — practical, not theoretical.

## Overview

These rules exist to keep the repository history navigable and to catch mistakes before they land. On June 13, 2026 several issues were closed as "implemented" but the code was never committed or pushed — the work simply vanished. This workflow prevents that: every change is tied to an open issue, lives on a named branch, and passes through a PR with automated checks.

## Issue Rules

- **Labels are mandatory.** Every issue needs at least one label (`bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.). Unlabelled issues are unclear and get deprioritized.
- **No issue, no work.** If there isn't an open issue describing the change, create one first. The issue is the source of truth for the "why."
- **One issue, one PR.** Don't bundle unrelated changes. If a fix reveals a new problem, file a separate issue and handle it in a follow-up PR.
- **Issue lifecycle:** `open` → `in progress` (when work starts) → `PR` (linked pull request) → `closed` (only after the PR merges). Never close an issue before its PR is merged.

## Commit Rules

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

Closes #N
```

### Types

| Type       | When to use                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | New feature or user-visible capability               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                              |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                           |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `style`    | Formatting, whitespace, UI styling — no behavior change |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                             |
| `chore`    | Build, tooling, dependency, or maintenance changes   |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                              |
| `build`    | Changes to build system or external dependencies     |
| `ci`       | CI/CD configuration changes                          |

### Footer

Link the issue in the commit footer so `git log` traces back to the original discussion:

```
Closes #29
```

Use `Closes` for the final commit that completes the issue. Use `Refs` for intermediate commits that touch the same issue.

## Branch Rules

Name branches following `type/issueN-description`:

```
feat/issue29-workflow-docs
fix/issue11-empty-chevron
docs/issue15-update-readme
refactor/issue42-simplify-session-worker
```

- `type` matches the commit type table above
- `issueN` is the GitHub issue number
- `description` is a short kebab-case summary

## PR Rules

- The PR template includes a checklist — fill it out completely.
- Every PR must reference an open issue. The link can be in the PR body or in a commit message.
- The PR title should follow conventional commit format (e.g. `feat: add workflow checks to CI`).

## Size Limits

| Limit      | Value          | When it applies        |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Files      | 10 (soft cap)  | Per PR                 |
| Lines      | 300 (soft cap) | Per PR (added + deleted) |

Soft caps — exceeding them triggers a CI warning, not a failure. If a PR legitimately needs more, add a note in the PR body explaining why.

## Enforcement

### Hard failures (block the PR)

The `workflow-checks` CI job enforces these automatically:

- **Conventional commit format** — every commit message must match `^(feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor|test|perf|build|ci|style)(\(.+\))?: .+`
- **Branch naming** — on pushes (not `main`), branch must match `^(feat|fix|chore|docs|refactor|test|perf)/issue[0-9]+-.*`
- **Issue reference** — at least one commit message or the PR body must contain `#[0-9]+`

### Soft warnings (print but don't fail)

- **Size limits** — if `git diff --shortstat` shows more than 10 files or 300 lines changed, a warning is printed.

## Exceptions

These changes may skip the issue requirement:

- Typo fixes in documentation
- Formatting-only changes (whitespace, lint auto-fixes)
- Dependency version bumps with no behavioral impact

Even then, use a conventional commit type (`docs`, `chore`) and keep the change in a separate PR.
